# String Calculator TDD Kata

## Tips:

Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers.
Remember to solve problems in a simple manner so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about.
Remember to refactor after each passing test.

## Steps:

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature like this:

   int add(string numbers)

   - Input: a string of comma-separated numbers
   - Output: an integer, sum of the numbers

   Examples:

   - Input: “”, Output: 0
   - Input: “1”, Output: 1
   - Input: “1,5”, Output: 6

2. Allow the add method to handle any amount of numbers.

3. Allow the add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas). ("1\n2,3" should return 6)

4. Support different delimiters:

   - To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]". For example, "//;\n1;2" where the delimiter is ";" should return 3.

5. Calling add with a negative number will throw an exception: "negative numbers not allowed <negative_number>".

   - If there are multiple negative numbers, show all of them in the exception message, separated by commas.

6. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2

7. Delimiters can be of any length with the following format: “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1**_2_**3” should return 6

8. Allow multiple delimiters like this: “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[\*][%]\n1\*2%3” should return 6.

9. make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
